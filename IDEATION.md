# Ideation Document — Conflict

## Problem Statement
While there are many competitive programming platforms, most lack **real-time, interactive coding battles**.
There’s no engaging, game-like platform that combines the fun of duels and the logic of CP — allowing users to challenge friends or random players live.

---

## Proposed Solution
**Conflict** will be a platform where programmers can:
- Compete in real-time coding battles.  
- Host or join friend challenges.  
- Earn **Crowns** to climb global and local leaderboards.  
- Submit and test code via the **Judge0 API** in a fair, timed environment.  
- Experience a CP platform that feels as competitive and thrilling as online gaming.

---

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, TailwindCSS / ShadCN UI  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database:** MySql / Prisma ORM
- **Code Execution:** Judge0 API  

---

## Expected Outcome
A fully functional, interactive, and scalable coding battle platform that allows users to:
- Compete live in coding duels and multiplayer havoc modes.  
- Earn Crowns and appear on leaderboards.  
- Experience coding as a competitive, community-driven experience.

The goal is to make **Conflict** the go-to destination for competitive programmers who want to battle, improve, and have fun.
